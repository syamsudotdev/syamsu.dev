For years, I have been thinking that a tech blog should host many well-written, comprehensive, elaborate articles. I always wanted to have a blog which leaves visitors engaged to read more of my articles. Even then, to make it easier to achieve, I was thinking doing this for one day, one article. That came out hardly from my drafts after several years, if not only months, LOL.

Now, I am treating this blog as a platform to blabber about anything, but related with my day to day life as a tech worker. I don't set target for long articles, nor comprehensive guide for problem resolution in programming. More like Twitter, but longer text `¯\_(ツ)\_/¯`.

Here is hoping to write more to prove my existence to the world.
