## My Coffee Journey

After burning through countless beans and early morning experiments with my espresso machine, I've finally found the code for my perfect cup. It has been a year of trial and error, there are several too bitter shots and too sour shots of espresso. But hey, this is just a hobby about finding an elusive cup of cafe latte that hits both bright fruity notes while keeping that satisfying chocolate punch.

## What Actually Works

Through all my testing, I found two crucial elements:

1. You need those punchy fruit-forward beans (but not too much - max 30%)
2. Back it up with darker, full-bodied beans (about 70%) for the backbone

## Bean Deep-Dive

| Origin           | What You'll Taste                     |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| Aceh Gayo        | Bright berries, almost wine-like      |
| Aceh Mandhailing | Dense, dark chocolate bomb            |
| Bali Kintamani   | Think sweet oranges meets brown sugar |
| Toraja           | Honey sweetness with subtle fruit     |
| Brazil Santos    | Classic coffee flavor, super rich     |
